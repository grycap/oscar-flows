# OSCAR Flows 🚀

This project enables the deployment of [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) inside an [OSCAR](https://oscar.grycap.net/) cluster, allowing users to interact with OSCAR and construct working flows, through defined Node-RED [nodes and examples](https://flows.nodered.org/collection/vAqHyycWgCq_).

## Forms of use 🛠️

To use this functionality from an OSCAR cluster, you simply need to enter the Dashboard and then go to `Flows` → `Deploy`.

You also can use the `flows.yaml` and `script.sh`, present in this repository and deploy it as an OSCAR service.

>
> ⚠️ **Warning**  
> If you want to deploy the service using `flows.yaml` and `script.sh`, don't forget to change the admin password that is in `flows.yaml`. 🔑

## OSCAR version considerations ⚠️

The definitions in `flows.yaml` and `script.sh` are not compatible with OSCAR clusters version 3.5.3 or lower, as these versions do not support secrets.  

To deploy the service on older versions, you need to change the admin password variable definition from `environment secrets` to `environment variables`.  

**Note:** ⚠️ This change will expose the admin password to all users who have access to the service.
